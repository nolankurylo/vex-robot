# vex-robot
A first year engineering collaborative project that required students to mechanically build and program a VEX robot to simulate a underwater cable being connected. Uses Robot C to operate various servo motors and transistors. My team was made up of myself, Matteo Aiello, and Prashant Tadeparti.
